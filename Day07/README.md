# Tasks Description :
* ***Task01*** : rewriting stack class using **Template**.

* ***Task02*** :  rewrite Day5Task with a new class shape that contain the color attribute and make Line,Circle and Triangle class inherite it.
* ***Task02v2*** : same task2 ,with printing statements to trace the code.
* ***Task03*** : difference between public and protected inheritance, as we have circle inherite from shape(that have 2 dimentions attribute , in circle 2Ds should equal each other) ,when that inhrritance is public that mean user(in main or any outer scope ) can chang any one of the dimentions by using setD1(..) or setD2(..) that conflict with circle consept.
The solution is to make the inheritance protected or private that appear in ***Task03v2***
